# esp8266-garage-door

This is the firmware for a esp8266 d1 mini to "forward" the pulse of a shelly1 to either one gpio or another, depending on a sensor. 

My garage does not have the BTN inputs in its board, and it also has different buttons for opening and closing, so I'll solder it to one of the remotes directly.
